Day6_Bed1,"It’s hard, but I need

Day1_Awakening,"New day.
Let’s begin."
Day2_Awakening,"I feel… off.
Maybe just tired."
Day3_Awakening,"Sleep didn’t help.
I just need to start moving."
Day4_Awakening,Feels like this body isn’t mine.
Day5_Awakening,Everything feels so heavy…
Day1_Sleep,"Wish I could just
get some real sleep."
Day2_Sleep,Can’t get it out of my head.
Day3_Sleep,What if tomorrow’s worse?
Day4_Sleep,"Please,
just make it all stop."
Day1_Door_Win,"Got a bit more energy
after the run."
Day1_Door_Defeat,No time to keep going.
Day2_Door_Win,Still in shape.
Day2_Door_Defeat,"Today was…
rough."
Day3_Door_Win,"It was hard,
but I’m not giving up."
Day3_Door_Defeat,It was hard…
Day4_Door_Win,My heart’s pounding.
Day4_Door_Defeat,I can’t do this anymore…
Day5_Door_Win,Can I still keep going?
Day5_Door_Defeat,"Feels like I’m not
in shape anymore."
Day6_Door0,No. Not today.
Day6_Door1,I can’t do this anymore...

Maybe next time."
Day2_Flower_Win,You’ve got this.
Day2_Flower_Defeat,"Withering’s easier
than I thought."
Day3_Flower_Win,"People say “Stay strong”.
So you hang in there too, huh."
Day3_Flower_Defeat,"“Stay strong”?
What the hell am I supposed
to stay strong for?"
Day4_Flower_Win,We’re alike.
Day4_Flower_Defeat,We’re alike.
Day5_Flower_Win,"Feels like we’re
both falling apart."

I just can’t."

Day2_Computer_Win,Is this supposed to be a joke?
Day2_Computer_Defeat,I can’t get it out of my head...
Day3_Computer_Win,"Well, I did everything I could."
Day3_Computer_Defeat,I can’t focus.
Day4_Computer_Win,...
Day4_Computer_Defeat,"“Stay strong”?
What does that even mean?!"
Day5_Computer_Win,Every message feels the same.
Day5_Computer_Defeat,The letters are blurring.
Day6_Computer0,"What does it say?
I can’t tell."
Day6_Computer1,It all feels like mockery.
Day6_Computer2,I can’t read this.
Day1_Guitar0,"I remember us singing
in the kitchen, the four of us…"
Day1_Guitar1,"We even talked about
playing on a stage someday..."
Day1_Guitar2,"Haven’t played in a while.
Should probably tune it sometime."
Day2_Guitar0,"We used to drag it to the lake:
campfire, wet sand,
strings smelling of smoke..."
Day2_Guitar1,"Now it’s just deadlines
and doctor’s visits.
The fires live in photos."
Day2_Guitar2,Someday I’ll hold you again.
Day3_Guitar0,"I can’t even remember
where A minor goes."
Day3_Guitar1,"My fingers shake,
and my head’s full
of test results."
Day3_Guitar2,"The guitar’s in the corner.
I’m not touching it.
Not now."
Day4_Guitar0,"String snapped.
Symbolic."
Day4_Guitar1,"Don’t even want to replace it.
Let it stay off."
Day4_Guitar2,"The strings ring too loud.
It’s irritating."
Day5_Guitar0,"I want it to sound again.
But I can’t."
Day5_Guitar1,"It’s dusty.
Feels like it’s not mine anymore."
Day5_Guitar2,"The guitar doesn’t recognize me.
And I don’t recognize it."
Day6_Guitar0,"Noise in my head
drowns everything."
Day6_Guitar1,"Too heavy.
Even my eyes slide past it."
Day6_Guitar2,I don’t have the strength.
Day1_Painting0,"I suddenly decided
I was going to paint…"
Day1_Painting1,"I bought brushes, canvases,
and even brought an easel
from the village..."
Day1_Painting2,And never finished a single one.
Day2_Painting0,"Every time I’d say:
“I’ll start painting as soon
as I wrap up this project”…"
Day2_Painting1,"Then another deadline.
And another…"
Day2_Painting2,"The canvases just sit there.
Waiting, same as me."
Day3_Painting0,"One day I picked up a brush
and just stared at the canvas…"
Day3_Painting1,"No image, no spark.
Only a low hum in my head…"
Day3_Painting2,"Set the brush down.
Didn’t even pour out the water."
Day4_Painting0,"These canvases weigh
on me like open loops…"
Day4_Painting1,"Everything unfinished
starts screaming louder…"
Day4_Painting2,"What was I even trying
to say with them?"
Day5_Painting0,"Shoved the whole stack
into a corner.
Kept bumping into it, got angry…"
Day5_Painting1,"Wanted to throw it all out,
but my hand wouldn’t move…"
Day5_Painting2,"They just get in the way.
Like so much else."
Day6_Painting0,"Too much emptiness.
Inside me, on the canvas…"
Day6_Painting1,Too late to finish anything now…
Day6_Painting2,No one’s going to see it anyway.
Day1_Books0,"I was always dragging books
home from sales
for “inspiration”…"
Day1_Books1,"Sometimes I’d read at night,
mark passages,
scribble in the margins…"
Day1_Books2,"I should at least finish
one someday."
Day2_Books0,"The bookmark’s still
on the same page..."
Day2_Books1,"What was it even about?
I forgot."
Day2_Books2,"The books stare at me.
Judging."
Day3_Books0,"My brain refuses
to absorb the text."
Day3_Books1,I can’t hold a single thought.
Day3_Books2,"Just meaningless words,
wrapped in paper."
Day4_Books0,"What could they tell me
that I’m not already feeling?"
Day4_Books1,No author wrote about this.
Day4_Books2,"Maybe I should throw them out.
Make space."
Day5_Books0,The shelf feels heavier somehow...
Day5_Books1,"It all presses down
like someone else’s expectations..."
Day5_Books2,"I don’t think I can
even read the titles anymore."
Day6_Books0,"Finishing them
won’t make me stronger."
Day6_Books1,"The books are gone.
Just empty rectangles now."
Day6_Books2,I can’t.
Day1_Basket0,"I wanted to learn knitting,
but I never had the patience."
Day1_Basket1,"Someday I’ll make a scarf.
Maybe for me.
Maybe for someone else."
Day1_Basket2,"The colors feel so warm.
Nice to touch."
Day2_Basket0,"There’s always something else.
No time for yarn."
Day2_Basket1,"I started a couple times.
Then gave up."
Day2_Basket2,They tangle just like my thoughts.
Day3_Basket0,"The hook’s broken.
I didn’t even notice when."
Day3_Basket1,"Everything feels so thin.
Fragile."
Day3_Basket2,"I can’t focus.
Every stitch feels like a task."
Day4_Basket0,"I’m not even angry.
Just watching it fade away..."
Day4_Basket1,Like everything else.
Day4_Basket2,A monument to old ambitions.
Day5_Basket0,Even the yarn looks tired.
Day5_Basket1,I should throw it out.
Day5_Basket2,"Why is it so hard
to let go of useless things?"
Day6_Basket0,"Fine motor skills
are the enemy now."
Day6_Basket1,My hands won’t listen.
Day6_Basket2,"Everything in this basket
is a frozen “what never was.”"
Day1_Window0,"I love the morning light.
Everything feels possible."
Day1_Window1,"Even the birds sound
like they’re whispering."
Day1_Window2,It’s a good day.
Day2_Window0,"It’s sunny… but strange.
Like it’s on delay."
Day2_Window1,"Today was supposed
to be a good day.
Maybe."
Day2_Window2,Fog?
Day3_Window0,Everyone else’s life keeps going…
Day3_Window1,"People move forward.
I feel like I’m not allowed."
Day3_Window2,"The world outside
looks out of focus."
Day4_Window0,"Rain noise makes
it hard to think."
Day4_Window1,"Puddles reflect the ceiling.
Can’t even see the sky."
Day4_Window2,"Everything’s gone gray.
Even the trees."
Day5_Window0,"Thunder, somewhere far off."
Day5_Window1,"Just water and glass.
That’s all."
Day5_Window2,There’s barely any light.
Day6_Window0,"Storm.
Lightning like torn-up thoughts."
Day6_Window1,"The world’s losing it.
And I’m just…
left behind."
Day6_Window2,"I can’t see anything.
Not even myself in the reflection."
